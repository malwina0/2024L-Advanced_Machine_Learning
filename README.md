# 2024L - Advanced Machine Learning

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms developed as part of the Advanced Machine Learning course. The focus is on understanding and implementing fundamental ML methods from scratch, analyzing their performance, and comparing different approaches on both simulated and real-world datasets.

___
### Task 1: Bayesian Classification
Implementation of LDA, QDA, and Naive Bayes classifiers from scratch. Comparison of their accuracy on simulated data under different statistical conditions and real-world datasets. Includes visualizations of decision boundaries and performance analysis through boxplots.

### Task 2: Logistic Regression
Logistic regression for predicting seismic shocks based on wave magnitudes, with model fitting using and without L2 regularization. A simulation study 

### Task 3: Bagging
Implementation of Bagging Classifier and Regressor algorithms using decision trees and comparison of their accuracy to a single decision tree on classification and regression datasets.

### Task 4: Density estimation
Implementation of kernel density estimation for a Gaussian mixture, analyzing mean squared error (MSE) with different kernel functions and smoothing parameters. Comparison of density estimation methods and Na√Øve Bayes classification approaches

### Task 5: Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression
Implementation of Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression and comparison its performance with Smoothing Splines regression. Exploration how MSE and predictions depends on the bandwidth parameter and sample size.
